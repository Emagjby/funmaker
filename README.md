# ðŸŽ² FunMaker

Virtual sports betting platform where you can place wagers using points instead of real money. The betting odds change dynamically based on how people bet - just like in real betting markets!

## What's this all about?

Ever wanted to try sports betting without risking actual money? FunMaker lets you:

- Bet on sports/events with virtual points (everybody starts with 1000)
- Watch odds change in real-time based on betting patterns
- Compete with friends on the leaderboard
- Experience the thrill of betting without the financial risk

The cool part is our dynamic odds system - as more people bet on an outcome, the odds for that outcome decrease automatically. This creates a realistic market-driven experience.
