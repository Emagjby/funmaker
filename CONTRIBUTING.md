# Contributing to Bookmaker

Thanks for your interest in helping with Bookmaker! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a labor of love, and we welcome contributions of all kinds.

## Getting Started

### Setup
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bookmaker.git`
3. Install dependencies (see main README)
4. Create a branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

### Development Workflow

We're pretty flexible, but here are some guidelines:

- Work on your own fork/branch
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature/fix
- Add tests when possible (but we won't reject PRs just because they don't have tests)
- Make sure everything builds!

## Pull Request Process

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Submit a PR against the `main` branch
3. Wait for feedback/review
4. Make any requested changes
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged

Don't worry if you need to make changes after submitting a PR - that's normal!

## Coding Style

We're not super strict, but we do try to follow these basic principles:

- Use TypeScript properly - add types where it makes sense
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic, but don't overdo it
- Use meaningful variable/function names

We use ESLint to help catch some common issues. Run `npm run lint` to check.

## Commit Messages

Try to use descriptive commit messages. We loosely follow the conventional commits format:

```
feat: add user profile page
fix: correct calculation error in odds algorithm
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify betting logic
```

But don't stress too much about it - the most important thing is that your commit message clearly explains what you did.

## Need Help?
